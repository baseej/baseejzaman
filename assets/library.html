     <p> I wished to say,' Fatima was the daughter of the great Khadija,' but I sensed this would not fully 
describe Fatima.
I wished to say, 'Fatima was the daughter of Muhammad,' but I sensed this would not fully describe 
Fatima.
I wished to say, 'Fatima was the wife of Ali,' but I sensed this would not fully describe Fatima.
I wished to say, 'Fatima was the mother of Hassan and Husayn,' but I sensed this would not fully 
describe Fatima.
I wished to say, 'Fatima is the mother of Zaynab,' but I still sensed this would not fully describe 
Fatima.
No, these are all true, and none of them is Fatima, 
Fatima is Fatima </p>

     <p> Martyr Babaei was born in 1950 in Qazvin city. He accomplished his elementary and high school in Qazvin and entered the Air Force Pilot School in 1969. When he passed the basic courses, he left for the United States of America in order to complete pilotage courses there.
According to the rules of the college, Babaei had to live with an American roommate for two months. At first face, the Americans would justify this work as a way of enhancing the students’ English language, but the reality was something else. Abbas would do all his religious practices and rituals in any conditions and he hated the licentiousness and immorality existing within some American students. Describing Abbas’ morality and behavior in a report, his roommate stressed "Babaei is a reserved and isolated person, and indifferent to customs and social norms. His behavior actually indicates his negative stance against Western culture; he is strongly committed to the traditional culture of Iran. He also pointed out that Babaei would go to a corner and talk to himself (Babaei actually would perform his daily prayers in that corner).</p>
